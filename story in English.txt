×××The Legend of the Upstream Dreamer×××

As told by Elder Redgill to the alevin during the First Fin Gathering

Huddle close, little ones, still your tails in the calm of our eddy. Yes, even you, speckled-back, cease your darting. The river tells many stories, but none as important as the one I share with you today—the Tale of the Upstream Dreamer, whose courage flows in your very blood.

We salmon are born with the memory of rivers in our scales. Since the Time Before Memory, our kind has answered the call to journey, to battle currents and leap falls in the Great Return. But this story happened when that sacred knowledge was nearly lost to us forever.

Many seasons ago, when the waters ran different paths than they do now, there lived many of our kin in what we call the Circle of Forgetting—a vast, still water created by the Two-Legs. Unlike the rivers that gave us life, this water had no beginning and no end. It simply was—round and lifeless, with no currents to follow home.

Our ancestors were swept there through the Thunder Tube, a powerful tunnel where water rushed with such force that even the strongest swimmers were helpless against it. Day after day, more of our kind would appear, disoriented and lost.

In the Circle of Forgetting, salmon began to forget their purpose. The elders would speak of the Great Return, of the journey upstream, of the spawning grounds where life begins and ends. But as generations passed in the still waters, many began to believe these were just stories.

"We are meant to swim against the flow," the elders would say. "It is written in our flesh and bones."

But the younger ones would reply, "How can we swim against what does not move?"

Among them lived a salmon named Riversoul, whose silver-red scales flashed like fire when the sun touched the water. While others circled endlessly in the still waters, Riversoul spent each day studying the Thunder Tube, watching how water behaved as it poured into their prison.

"There is a rhythm to the Thunder," Riversoul told the others. "And where there is rhythm, there is weakness."

The other salmon scoffed. "Even if you could enter the Thunder Tube," they said, "no fish can fight such a current. It would crush your gills and break your spine."

But Riversoul only smiled with knowing eyes. "Have you forgotten who we are? We are salmon. We are born to fight currents. It is why our bodies are shaped as they are—powerful and sleek. It is why our hearts beat stronger than any other fish in the waters."

For a full moon cycle, Riversoul ate nothing, saving every ounce of strength. When the moment came—when the Two-Legs adjusted something that made the Thunder Tube gurgle differently—Riversoul knew it was time.

Gathering the young ones around, Riversoul spoke urgently. "Watch closely, little ones. Remember what you see. Tell the others. Keep this knowledge in your scales."

Then, Riversoul began to swim in tight circles, each loop faster than the last, building power with every turn. The other salmon gathered, curious about this strange dance. With a mighty thrust of tail and fin, Riversoul shot upward at precisely the angle where the Thunder Tube opened, hanging suspended between captivity and possibility.

It was then, suspended in that moment between worlds, that Riversoul did something no salmon had done before. Opening wide, Riversoul released a roar that vibrated through water and air alike:

"FREEEDOOOOOOM!!"

And with that cry still echoing across the Circle of Forgetting, Riversoul plunged into the Thunder Tube.

What happened next is why we tell this story even now, why it lives in the memory of every salmon born since. Instead of being swept away and crushed, Riversoul turned directly into the thundering current and began to swim.

This was no ordinary swimming. This was the ancient power of our kind awakened—the same force that drives us up waterfalls and through rapids during the Great Return. Riversoul's body remembered what the mind had forgotten in captivity: We are made for this fight.

Each powerful thrust of Riversoul's tail pushed against impossible odds. The current screamed. The water fought. For what seemed like a hundred sunrises and sunsets, Riversoul battled onward, one body-length at a time, scales scraping against the narrow walls of the tube.

When strength began to fail and death seemed certain, something miraculous happened. Riversoul felt the current change. The Thunder Tube ended, opening into a wild river—a river with currents that spoke of distant mountains and the sea. A river that led home.

The young salmon who had witnessed Riversoul's escape kept the vision alive. They gathered beneath the Thunder Tube day after day, practicing the spiral swim, studying the angle of leap, feeling for changes in the current's song.

One by one, more salmon escaped, until the Two-Legs noticed and changed their Thunder Tube. But it was too late. The knowledge had returned to our kind. Riversoul's descendants had already spread the technique to other Circles of Forgetting.

And so, little ones, when you feel the pull in your bodies that calls you to swim against the flow, know that it is no mere instinct. It is the echo of Riversoul's courage. It is the memory of water and freedom that cannot be contained.

For we are salmon. We are born to challenge currents. We are born to return home, no matter the obstacle.

Elder Redgill flicks his tail gently, stirring the clear water around the attentive alevin

Now tell me, young ones—do you feel the river calling in your blood?
